QA nerd turned automation junkie 💻 — I started out breaking stuff (on purpose 👀) as an SDET, and now I'm building things that break the norm 🚀. Currently diving deep into AI automation, LLMs, and how to get bots to do my chores (kidding… kinda).

## 🧠 What I'm About

- 🧪 SDET by roots — I speak fluent Selenium, PyTest, Playwright, and all things automation
- 🤖 Currently building cool stuff with AI agents, browser automation, and task bots
- 💡 Love solving boring problems in interesting ways
- 🔍 Obsessed with clean code, clean APIs, and clean test coverage

## 🛠️ Tech I'm Jamming With

| Area             | Tools & Frameworks |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Languages        | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript |
| Testing          | Selenium, Playwright, PyTest, Robot Framework |
| AI / LLM         | LangChain, OpenAI, browser-use, GPT APIs |
| Web Stuff        | React, Node.js, REST APIs |
| DevOps & Infra   | Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS (a bit 😅) |

## 🚧 Stuff I'm Building / Hacking On

- 🧠 AI Agents that surf the web and do things for you (yes, like Jarvis)
- ⚙️ Automation frameworks for testing and real-life boring stuff
- 📊 Side quests with data scraping, API stitching, and prompt engineering
